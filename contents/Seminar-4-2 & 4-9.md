# Seminar-4-2

```
Dear all,

Our seminar will be held online on April.2. 16:40~17:40. I will introduce the topic on reinforcement learning techniques for the sim-to-real problem  based on the following papers:

1. Sim to real tranafer of robotic control with dynamic randomization.（https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06537）

2. Asymmetric actor-critic for image-based robot learning.（arXiv:1710.06542 ）

3. Attention privileged reinforcement learning.（arXiv:1911.08363 ）

Best wishes
Hui

Dear all,

We’ll have our seminar tomorrow (Apr. 9th) at 16:40. I’ll talk about a series of papers on predictive uncertainty of neural networks,

1. On Calibration of Modern Neural Networks
2. Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Represent Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning
3. Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation Using Deep Ensembles
4. Can You Trust Your Model’s Uncertainty? Evaluating Uncertainty under Dataset Shift
